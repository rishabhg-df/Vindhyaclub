            <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
              Founded in 1995, Vindhya Club started as a small community of
              sports lovers with a shared dream: to create a space where
              passion for sports could thrive. Over the decades, we've grown
              into a premier sports institution, but our core values remain
              unchanged.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We believe in the power of sport to bring people together,
              foster discipline, and create lasting memories. Our
              state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated team are here to
              support every member, from the aspiring athlete to the weekend
              warrior.
